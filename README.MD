### Main Features

- **Total Element Management:**
    - **Items:** Remove or replace duplicate or unwanted items.
    - **Recipes:** Adjust, remove, or modify recipes. If you replace an item, the recipes will be updated to avoid breaking the mods.
    - **Blocks:** Delete or substitute blocks to prevent conflicts and repetition.
    - **Biomes:** Control world generation by removing or modifying biomes that don't match your style.
    - **Entities:** Delete or replace entities easily.

- **Compatibility:**
    - Works perfectly with **JEI**, **REI**, and **EMI**; removed elements will not be visible and the recipes will display correctly.

- **For Creators and Players:**
    - **Modpack Creator:** Ideal for resolving conflicts between mods and maintaining balanced progression.
    - **Casual Player:** Perfect for experimenting, imposing restrictions on servers, or creating unique challenges, such as turning water into lava or dirt into diamond blocks.

- **Simple Configuration:**
    - All customization is managed through the `config/easy_modpack/` folder, making configuration intuitive and accessible.
