# Easy Modpack

## The Ultimate Tool for Creating and Fixing Modpacks

Are you tired of different mods repeating elements or unbalancing your pack's progression? Easy Modpack gives you the power to customize your experience by removing and replacing everything that doesn't fit your vision.

### Main Features

- **Total Element Management:**
    - **Items:** Remove or replace duplicate or unwanted items.
    - **Recipes:** Adjust, remove, or modify recipes. If you replace an item, the recipes will be updated to avoid breaking the mods.
    - **Blocks:** Delete or substitute blocks to prevent conflicts and repetition.
    - **Biomes:** Control world generation by removing or modifying biomes that don't match your style.
    - **Entities:** Delete or replace entities easily.

- **Compatibility:**
    - Works perfectly with **JEI**, **REI**, and **EMI**; removed elements will not be visible and the recipes will display correctly.

- **For Creators and Players:**
    - **Modpack Creator:** Ideal for resolving conflicts between mods and maintaining balanced progression.
    - **Casual Player:** Perfect for experimenting, imposing restrictions on servers, or creating unique challenges, such as turning water into lava or dirt into diamond blocks.

- **Simple Configuration:**
    - All customization is managed through the `config/easy_modpack/` folder, making configuration intuitive and accessible.
