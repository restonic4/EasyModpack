It also breaks the entire overworld generation, because minecraft first creates the shape of the world with minecraft:stone and then it decorates it, but if you replace minecraft:stone by something that can not be decorated such as minecraft:bedrock, then, the entire world will bedrock with no tress, no flowers, just bedrock."
